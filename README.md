# Library-Managememt-System
Using various data structures and algorithms to ease the process of managing a library.

## Features:
### 1. Add a book 
It takes the book name and shelf no. as input.
Then, it adds the book in the library and keeps it at the shelf no. in the input. 

### 2. Search a book 
It takes the book name as input and tells if the book is present in the library or not. 
If present, it tells the shelf no. where the book is kept.

### 3. Find number of books between 2 shelf positions  
It takes two shelf no.'s l and r as input.
Then, it finds the number of books kept between the two shelf positions in the Library.

### 4. Swap books kept at 2 shelf positions  
It takes two shelf no.'s x and y as input.
Then, it swaps the books that were kept at those positions.

### 5. Remove a book 
It takes the book name as input and removes the book from library. 
It also tells the shelf no. from which the book was removed.

## Data Structures and Algorithms used:
### 1. Trie: 
For searching a book in the library.

### 2. Fenwick Tree
For finding number of books between two shelf positions in the Library.
